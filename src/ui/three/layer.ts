/**
 * The contract every part of the 3D scene keeps.
 *
 * The scene is built from layers — backdrop, terrain, ships, ordnance,
 * overlays, effects — each owning one `THREE.Group` and nothing else. The
 * orchestrator (`BattleScene`) hands every layer the same view of the battle
 * whenever it changes, and a clock every frame. A layer diffs the battle
 * against what it has built (by id) rather than rebuilding, so a hull that
 * has not changed is not touched and an animation in flight is not restarted.
 *
 * Layers never change the game. Like the 2D map, everything here is a pure
 * reading of `GameState` plus the view's own props.
